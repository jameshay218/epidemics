Note it is advised that you 'make clean' and 'make' the program before
use. There should be no unusual library requirements (other than
perhaps boost). Gnuplot-iostream should be provided in this folder to
allow printing of graphs.

The Single Epidemic fitting framework offers the following features:

1. Iterative fitting of a .csv file of epidemic data. The file must be
set to comma separated values only, and contain two columns. The first
column must contain a time series from 0 to N, and the second column
contains the data to be fit.

2. Upon execution, the user is prompted to specify default or custom
options. Default options are to use an SSE based fitting procedure,
save graphs, and to not include IO in the fitting. The user may choose
to include I0, not save graphs, and to use the MLE based fitting
procedure instead (not currently functional).

3. The user must specify a valid .csv file and valid save directory at
run time. Providing invalid file locations will prompt the user to
correct these.

4. The program outputs a series of Gnuplot created graphs and a .csv
file of the model fitting results at each time point to the provided directory.
